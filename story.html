            Preparation is what defines the winner of a battle and 2017 was just that perfect preparation time for us. Everyone became busy making themselves capable for execution of some crazy ideas. Some focused on marketing, some focused on full-stack web development, some on financing, graphics design, photography etc. Everyone was busy not lagging behind the rest of the people.

            At the end of the year we started working on our first startup idea. It was a hell of an excitement after hoping for the best. No one knew what was ahead of us, but all we cared about is the amount of fun we were having doing work.
